# llm-agent

## Introduction

Welcome!

The goal of llm-agent is to simplify integrating LLMs into Java applications.

This project was started to enable convenient access to LLMs during the development of our company's internal systems.

We are continuously developing this library. Although certain features are still under construction, 
the core capabilities are established, empowering you to start creating LLM-driven applications right now!
